## ðŸ‘‹Welcome to my CodeWars!

This is my codewars repo. Since February 8th, 2023, I've been writing code every single day. Sometimes that means work on projects, but often I just have time for a code wars! The goal in the short term is 30 days of code, but I think an entire year of code is possible!

## Update

I've started doing C# Code Wars as well! You can find each language in a separate folder. All the C# solutions are in a single project.

## Template

Each of my files (except the first few) follow this template:

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Date Completed
// KYU
// Lang

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// Prompt

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// My Solution

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// Favorite Solution

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// What I learned

This is just a way for me to track the things I've learned and see how far I've come. Each day there is a successful attempt. That means there may be 2 or 3 I wasn't able to do that day.
