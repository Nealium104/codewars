//     /* Now this is the story all about how
//         My life got flipped, turned upside down
//         And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there
//         I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-air
        
//         In west Philadelphia born and raised
//         On the playground where I spent most of my days
//         Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool
//         And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
//         When a couple of guys, they were up to no good
//         Started making trouble in my neighbourhood
//         I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
//         And said "You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-air"
        
//         I whistled for a cab and when it came near the
//         License plate said "fresh" and had a dice in the mirror
//         If anything I could say that this cab was rare
//         But I thought nah, forget it, yo homes to Bel-air!
        
//         I pulled up to a house about seven or eight
//         And I yelled to the cabby "Yo, homes smell you later!"
//         Looked at my kingdom I was finally there
//         To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-air */
