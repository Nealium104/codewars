Tried to do it by comparing each number to the numbers around it to judge, but I re-read the question and realized I could solve just by looking at the outer numbers instead! Also had to review how Lists work. I kept forgetting the (), but we need that because weâ€™re calling the constructor (which is a function) for List when we make a new list, hence the ().
